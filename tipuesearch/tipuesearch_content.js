This routine is called by routines SPLCW and SPLDE\nto compute ICOL and BASM, which are defined as follows: The MDIM indices in IB (defined through common) determine\n   a specific node in the node grid (see routine SPLCC for a\n   description of the node grid).  Every node is associated\n   with an MDIM-dimensional basis function and a corresponding\n   column in the least squares matrix (or element of the\n   coefficient vector).  The column index (which may be thought\n   of as a linear address for the MDIM-dimensional node grid)\n   corresponding to the specified node is computed as ICOL.  The\n   associated basis function evaluated at X (an MDIM-vector) is\n   computed as BASM (a scalar). In case NDERIV is not all zero, BASM will not be the value of\nthe basis function but rather a partial derivative of that\nfunction as follows: The order of the partial derivative in the direction of the\n   IDIM coordinate is NDERIV(IDIM) (for IDIM <= MDIM).  This\n   routine will compute incorrect values if NDERIV(IDIM) is not\n   in the range 0 to 2. The technique of this routine is to transform the independent\nvariable in each dimension such that the nodes fall on\nsuitably chosen integers.  On this transformed space, the\n1-dimensional basis functions and their derivatives have a\nparticularly simple form.  The desired MDIM-dimensional basis\nfunction (or any of its partial derivatives) is computed as\na product of such 1-dimensional functions (tensor product\nmethod of defining multi-dimensional splines).  The values\nwhich determine the location of the nodes, and hence the\nabove transform, are passed through common and the argument\nlist.

The spline (or its derivatives) may then be\n  evaluated by using function splfe (or splde ). A grid of evenly spaced nodes in NDIM space is\n  defined by the arguments XMIN, XMAX and NODES.\n  A linear basis for the class of natural splines\n  on these nodes is formed, and a set of\n  corresponding coefficients is computed in the\n  array COEF.  These coefficients are chosen to\n  minimize the weighted sum of squared errors\n  between the spline and the arbitrarily located\n  data values described by the arguments XDATA,\n  YDATA and NDATA.  The smoothness of the spline\n  in data sparse areas is controlled by the\n  argument XTRAP. Note In order to understand the arguments of this\n  routine, one should realize that the node grid\n  need not bear any particular relation to the\n  data points.  In the theory of exact-fit\n  interpolatory splines, the nodes would in fact\n  be data locations, but in this case they serve\n  only to define the class of splines from which\n  the approximating function is chosen.  This\n  node grid is a rectangular arrangement of\n  points in NDIM space, with the restriction that\n  along any coordinate direction the nodes are\n  equally spaced.  The class of natural splines\n  on this grid of nodes (NDIM-cubic splines whose\n  2nd derivatives normal to the boundaries are 0)\n  has as many degrees of freedom as the grid has\n  nodes.  Thus the smoothness or flexibility of\n  the splines is determined by the choice of the\n  node grid. Algorithm An overdetermined system of linear equations\n  is formed -- one equation for each data point\n  plus equations for derivative constraints.\n  This system is solved using subroutine suprls . Accuracy If there is exactly one data point in the\n  near vicinity of each node and no extra data,\n  the resulting spline will agree with the\n  data values to machine accuracy.  However, if\n  the problem is overdetermined or the sparse\n  data option is utilized, the accuracy is hard\n  to predict.  Basically, smooth functions\n  require fewer nodes than rough ones for the\n  same accuracy. Timing The execution time is roughly proportional\n  to NDATA*NCOF**2 where NCOF = NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM) . Arguments Type Intent Optional Attributes Name integer, intent(in) :: ndim The dimensionality of the problem.  The\nspline is a function of NDIM variables or\ncoordinates and thus a point in the\nindependent variable space is an NDIM vector. NDIM must be in the range 1 <= NDIM <= 4 . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: xdata (l1xdat,ndata) A collection of locations for the data\nvalues, i.e., points from the independent\nvariable space.  This collection is a\n2-dimensional array whose 1st dimension\nindexes the NDIM coordinates of a given point\nand whose 2nd dimension labels the data\npoint.  For example, the data point with\nlabel IDATA is located at the point (XDATA(1,IDATA),...,XDATA(NDIM,IDATA)) where\nthe elements of this vector are the values of\nthe NDIM coordinates.  The location, number\nand ordering of the data points is arbitrary.\nThe dimension of XDATA is assumed to be XDATA(L1XDAT,NDATA) . integer, intent(in) :: l1xdat The length of the 1st dimension of XDATA in\n the calling program. L1XDAT must be >= NDIM . Note: For 1-dimensional problems L1XDAT is usually 1. real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: ydata (ndata) A collection of data values corresponding to\nthe points in XDATA . YDATA(IDATA) is the\ndata value associated with the point (XDATA(1,IDATA),...,XDATA(NDIM,IDATA)) in the\nindependent variable space.  The spline whose\ncoefficients are computed by this routine\napproximates these data values in the least\nsquares sense.  The dimension is assumed to be YDATA(NDATA) . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: wdata (:) A collection of weights. WDATA(IDATA) is a\n weight associated with the data point\n labelled IDATA .  It should be non-negative,\n but may be of any magnitude.  The weights\n have the effect of forcing greater or lesser\n accuracy at a given point as follows: this\n routine chooses coefficients to minimize the\n sum over all data points of the quantity ( WDATA ( IDATA ) * ( YDATA ( IDATA ) ! spline value at XDATA(IDATA)))**2. Thus, if the reliability\n of a data point is known to be low, the\n corresponding weight may be made small\n (relative to the other weights) so that the\n sum over all data points is affected less by\n discrepencies at the unreliable point.  Data\n points with zero weight are completely\n ignored. Note: If WDATA(1) is < 0 , the other\n elements of WDATA are not\n referenced, and all weights are\n assumed to be unity. The dimension is assumed to be WDATA(NDATA) unless WDATA(1) < 0. , in which case the\n dimension is assumed to be 1. integer, intent(in) :: ndata The number of data points mentioned in the\nabove arguments. real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: xmin (ndim) A vector describing the lower extreme corner\nof the node grid.  A set of evenly spaced\nnodes is formed along each coordinate axis\nand XMIN(IDIM) is the location of the first\nnode along the IDIM axis.  The dimension is\nassumed to be XMIN(NDIM) . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: xmax (ndim) A vector describing the upper extreme corner\nof the node grid.  A set of evenly spaced\nnodes is formed along each coordinate axis\nand XMAX(IDIM) is the location of the last\nnode along the IDIM axis.  The dimension is\nassumed to be XMAX(NDIM) . integer, intent(in) :: nodes (ndim) A vector of integers describing the number of\n nodes along each axis. NODES(IDIM) is the\n number of nodes (counting endpoints) along\n the IDIM axis and determines the flexibility\n of the spline in that coordinate direction. NODES(IDIM) must be >= 4 , but may be as\n large as the arrays COEF and WORK allow.\n The dimension is assumed to be NODES(NDIM) . Note: The node grid is completely defined by\n the arguments XMIN , XMAX and NODES .\n The spacing of this grid in the IDIM coordinate direction is: DX ( IDIM ) = ( XMAX ( IDIM ) - XMIN ( IDIM )) / ( NODES ( IDIM ) - 1 ). A node in this grid may be indexed by\n an NDIM vector of integers (IN(1),...,IN(NDIM)) where 1 <= IN(IDIM) <= NODES(IDIM) .\n The location of such a node may be\n represented by an NDIM vector (X(1),...,X(NDIM)) where X(IDIM) = XMIN(IDIM) + (IN(IDIM)-1) * DX(IDIM) . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: xtrap A parameter to control extrapolation to data\n sparse areas.  The region described by XMIN and XMAX is divided into rectangles, the\n number of which is determined by NODES , and\n any rectangle containing a disproportionately\n small number of data points is considered to\n be data sparse (rectangle is used here to\n mean NDIM -dimensional rectangle).  If XTRAP is nonzero the least squares problem is\n augmented with derivative constraints in the\n data sparse areas to prevent the matrix from\n becoming poorly conditioned. XTRAP serves as\n a weight for these constraints, and thus may\n be used to control smoothness in data sparse\n areas.  Experience indicates that unity is a\n good first guess for this parameter.

The number of data points mentioned in the !! above arguments. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: xdata ( l1xdat , ndata ) !! A collection of locations for the data !! values, i.e., points from the independent !! variable space.  This collection is a !! 2-dimensional array whose 1st dimension !! indexes the `NDIM` coordinates of a given point !! and whose 2nd dimension labels the data !! point.  For example, the data point with !! label `IDATA` is located at the point !! `(XDATA(1,IDATA),...,XDATA(NDIM,IDATA))` where !! the elements of this vector are the values of !! the `NDIM` coordinates.  The location, number !! and ordering of the data points is arbitrary. !! The dimension of `XDATA` is assumed to be !! `XDATA(L1XDAT,NDATA)`. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: ydata ( ndata ) !! A collection of data values corresponding to !! the points in `XDATA`.  `YDATA(IDATA)` is the !! data value associated with the point !! `(XDATA(1,IDATA),...,XDATA(NDIM,IDATA))` in the !! independent variable space.  The spline whose !! coefficients are computed by this routine !! approximates these data values in the least !! squares sense.  The dimension is assumed to be !! `YDATA(NDATA)`. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: wdata (:) !! A collection of weights.  `WDATA(IDATA)` is a !! weight associated with the data point !! labelled `IDATA`.  It should be non-negative, !! but may be of any magnitude.  The weights !! have the effect of forcing greater or lesser !! accuracy at a given point as follows: this !! routine chooses coefficients to minimize the !! sum over all data points of the quantity !!```fortran !!   (WDATA(IDATA)*(YDATA(IDATA) ! spline value at XDATA(IDATA)))**2. !!``` !! Thus, if the reliability !! of a data point is known to be low, the !! corresponding weight may be made small !! (relative to the other weights) so that the !! sum over all data points is affected less by !! discrepencies at the unreliable point.  Data !! points with zero weight are completely !! ignored. !! !!#### Note: !! If `WDATA(1)` is `< 0`, the other !! elements of `WDATA` are not !! referenced, and all weights are !! assumed to be unity. !! !!

A vector describing the lower extreme corner !! of the node grid.

The dimension is !! assumed to be `XMAX(NDIM)`. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: xtrap !! A parameter to control extrapolation to data !! sparse areas.  The region described by `XMIN` !! and `XMAX` is divided into rectangles, the !! number of which is determined by `NODES`, and !! any rectangle containing a disproportionately !! small number of data points is considered to !! be data sparse (rectangle is used here to !! mean `NDIM`-dimensional rectangle).  If `XTRAP` !! is nonzero the least squares problem is !! augmented with derivative constraints in the !! data sparse areas to prevent the matrix from !! becoming poorly conditioned.  `XTRAP` serves as !! a weight for these constraints, and thus may !! be used to control smoothness in data sparse !! areas.  Experience indicates that unity is a !! good first guess for this parameter. !! !!#### Note: !! If `XTRAP` is zero, substantial !! portions of the routine will be !! skipped, but a singular matrix !! can result if large portions of !! the region are without data. integer , intent ( in ) :: nodes ( ndim ) !! A vector of integers describing the number of !! nodes along each axis.  `NODES(IDIM)` is the !! number of nodes (counting endpoints) along !! the `IDIM` axis and determines the flexibility !! of the spline in that coordinate direction. !! `NODES(IDIM)` must be `>= 4`, but may be as !! large as the arrays `COEF` and `WORK` allow. !! The dimension is assumed to be `NODES(NDIM)`. !! !!#### Note: !! The node grid is completely defined by !! the arguments `XMIN`, `XMAX` and `NODES`. !! The spacing of this grid in the `IDIM` !! coordinate direction is: !!```fortran !!   DX(IDIM) = (XMAX(IDIM)-XMIN(IDIM)) / (NODES(IDIM)-1). !!``` !! A node in this grid may be indexed by !! an `NDIM` vector of integers !! `(IN(1),...,IN(NDIM))` where !! `1 <= IN(IDIM) <= NODES(IDIM)`. !!

A workspace array for solving the least !! squares matrix generated by this routine. !! Its required size is a function of the total !! number of nodes in the node grid.  This !! total, `NCOL = NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM)`, is !! also the number of columns in the least !! squares matrix.  The length of the array `WORK` !! must equal or exceed `NCOL*(NCOL+1)`. real ( wp ), intent ( out ) :: coef ( ncf ) !! The array of coefficients computed by this !! routine.  Each coefficient corresponds to a !! particular basis function which in turn !! corresponds to a node in the node grid.  This !! correspondence between the node grid and the !! array `COEF` is as if `COEF` were an !! `NDIM`-dimensional Fortran array with !! dimensions `NODES(1),...,NODES(NDIM)`, i.e., to !! store the array linearly, the leftmost !! indices are incremented most frequently. !!

Read more… Arguments Type Intent Optional Attributes Name integer, intent(in) :: ndim The dimensionality of the problem.  The\nspline is a function of NDIM variables or\ncoordinates and thus a point in the\nindependent variable space is an NDIM vector. NDIM must be in the range 1 <= NDIM <= 4 . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: xdata (l1xdat,ndata) A collection of locations for the data\nvalues, i.e., points from the independent\nvariable space.  This collection is a\n2-dimensional array whose 1st dimension\nindexes the NDIM coordinates of a given point\nand whose 2nd dimension labels the data\npoint.  For example, the data point with\nlabel IDATA is located at the point (XDATA(1,IDATA),...,XDATA(NDIM,IDATA)) where\nthe elements of this vector are the values of\nthe NDIM coordinates.  The location, number\nand ordering of the data points is arbitrary.\nThe dimension of XDATA is assumed to be XDATA(L1XDAT,NDATA) . integer, intent(in) :: l1xdat The length of the 1st dimension of XDATA in\n the calling program. L1XDAT must be >= NDIM . Read more… real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: ydata (ndata) A collection of data values corresponding to\nthe points in XDATA . YDATA(IDATA) is the\ndata value associated with the point (XDATA(1,IDATA),...,XDATA(NDIM,IDATA)) in the\nindependent variable space.  The spline whose\ncoefficients are computed by this routine\napproximates these data values in the least\nsquares sense.  The dimension is assumed to be YDATA(NDATA) . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: wdata (:) A collection of weights. WDATA(IDATA) is a\n weight associated with the data point\n labelled IDATA .  It should be non-negative,\n but may be of any magnitude.  The weights\n have the effect of forcing greater or lesser\n accuracy at a given point as follows: this\n routine chooses coefficients to minimize the\n sum over all data points of the quantity Read more… integer, intent(in) :: ndata The number of data points mentioned in the\nabove arguments. real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: xmin (ndim) A vector describing the lower extreme corner\nof the node grid.  A set of evenly spaced\nnodes is formed along each coordinate axis\nand XMIN(IDIM) is the location of the first\nnode along the IDIM axis.  The dimension is\nassumed to be XMIN(NDIM) . real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: xmax (ndim) A vector describing the upper extreme corner\nof the node grid.  A set of evenly spaced\nnodes is formed along each coordinate axis\nand XMAX(IDIM) is the location of the last\nnode along the IDIM axis.  The dimension is\nassumed to be XMAX(NDIM) . integer, intent(in) :: nodes (ndim) A vector of integers describing the number of\n nodes along each axis. NODES(IDIM) is the\n number of nodes (counting endpoints) along\n the IDIM axis and determines the flexibility\n of the spline in that coordinate direction. NODES(IDIM) must be >= 4 , but may be as\n large as the arrays COEF and WORK allow.\n The dimension is assumed to be NODES(NDIM) . Read more… real(kind=wp), intent(in) :: xtrap A parameter to control extrapolation to data\n sparse areas.  The region described by XMIN and XMAX is divided into rectangles, the\n number of which is determined by NODES , and\n any rectangle containing a disproportionately\n small number of data points is considered to\n be data sparse (rectangle is used here to\n mean NDIM -dimensional rectangle).  If XTRAP is nonzero the least squares problem is\n augmented with derivative constraints in the\n data sparse areas to prevent the matrix from\n becoming poorly conditioned. XTRAP serves as\n a weight for these constraints, and thus may\n be used to control smoothness in data sparse\n areas.  Experience indicates that unity is a\n good first guess for this parameter. Read more… real(kind=wp), intent(out) :: coef (ncf) The array of coefficients computed by this\nroutine.  Each coefficient corresponds to a\nparticular basis function which in turn\ncorresponds to a node in the node grid.  This\ncorrespondence between the node grid and the\narray COEF is as if COEF were an NDIM -dimensional Fortran array with\ndimensions NODES(1),...,NODES(NDIM) , i.e., to\nstore the array linearly, the leftmost\nindices are incremented most frequently.\nHence the length of the COEF array must equal\nor exceed the total number of nodes, which is NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM) .  The computed array COEF may be used with function splfe (or splde ) to evaluate the spline (or its\nderivatives) at an arbitrary point in NDIM space.  The dimension is assumed to be COEF(NCF) . integer, intent(in) :: ncf The length of the array COEF in the calling\nprogram.  If NCF is < NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM) ,\na fatal error is diagnosed. real(kind=wp) :: work (nwrk) A workspace array for solving the least\nsquares matrix generated by this routine.\nIts required size is a function of the total\nnumber of nodes in the node grid.  This\ntotal, NCOL = NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM) , is\nalso the number of columns in the least\nsquares matrix.  The length of the array WORK must equal or exceed NCOL*(NCOL+1) . integer, intent(in) :: nwrk The length of the array WORK in the calling\nprogram.  If NCOL = NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM) is the total\nnumber of nodes, then a fatal error is\ndiagnosed if NWRK is less than NCOL*(NCOL+1) . integer, intent(out) :: ierror An error flag with the following meanings: Read more… public  subroutine suprls (i, rowi, n, bi, a, nn, soln, err, ier) Solve the overdetermined system of linear equations.

This routine does basis function computations for natural !  splines.  This routine is called by routines SPLCW and SPLDE !  to compute ICOL and BASM, which are defined as follows: ! !     The MDIM indices in IB (defined through common) determine !     a specific node in the node grid (see routine SPLCC for a !     description of the node grid).  Every node is associated !     with an MDIM-dimensional basis function and a corresponding !     column in the least squares matrix (or element of the !     coefficient vector).  The column index (which may be thought !     of as a linear address for the MDIM-dimensional node grid) !     corresponding to the specified node is computed as ICOL.  The !     associated basis function evaluated at X (an MDIM-vector) is !     computed as BASM (a scalar). ! !  In case NDERIV is not all zero, BASM will not be the value of !  the basis function but rather a partial derivative of that !  function as follows: ! !     The order of the partial derivative in the direction of the !     IDIM coordinate is NDERIV(IDIM) (for IDIM <= MDIM).  This !     routine will compute incorrect values if NDERIV(IDIM) is not !     in the range 0 to 2. ! !  The technique of this routine is to transform the independent !  variable in each dimension such that the nodes fall on !  suitably chosen integers.  On this transformed space, the !  1-dimensional basis functions and their derivatives have a !  particularly simple form.  The desired MDIM-dimensional basis !  function (or any of its partial derivatives) is computed as !  a product of such 1-dimensional functions (tensor product !  method of defining multi-dimensional splines).  The values !  which determine the location of the nodes, and hence the !  above transform, are passed through common and the argument !  list. subroutine bascmp ( x , nderiv , xmin , nodes , icol , basm ) real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: x ( 4 ) integer , intent ( in ) :: nderiv ( 4 ) real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: xmin ( 4 ) integer , intent ( in ) :: nodes ( 4 ) integer , intent ( out ) :: icol real ( wp ), intent ( out ) :: basm real ( wp ) :: xb , bas1 , z , fact , z1 integer :: idim , mdmid , ntyp , ngo real ( wp ) :: dx ( 4 ), dxin ( 4 ) integer :: mdim , ib ( 4 ), ibmn ( 4 ), ibmx ( 4 ) common / splcomd / dx , dxin , mdim , ib , ibmn , ibmx save !

N-dimensional cubic spline coefficient !  calculation by weighted least squares on !  arbitrarily located data. ! !  The spline (or its derivatives) may then be !  evaluated by using function [[SPLFE]] (or [[SPLDE]]). ! !  A grid of evenly spaced nodes in NDIM space is !  defined by the arguments XMIN, XMAX and NODES. !  A linear basis for the class of natural splines !  on these nodes is formed, and a set of !  corresponding coefficients is computed in the !  array COEF.  These coefficients are chosen to !  minimize the weighted sum of squared errors !  between the spline and the arbitrarily located !  data values described by the arguments XDATA, !  YDATA and NDATA.  The smoothness of the spline !  in data sparse areas is controlled by the !  argument XTRAP. ! !### Note !  In order to understand the arguments of this !  routine, one should realize that the node grid !  need not bear any particular relation to the !  data points.  In the theory of exact-fit !  interpolatory splines, the nodes would in fact !  be data locations, but in this case they serve !  only to define the class of splines from which !  the approximating function is chosen.  This !  node grid is a rectangular arrangement of !  points in NDIM space, with the restriction that !  along any coordinate direction the nodes are !  equally spaced.  The class of natural splines !  on this grid of nodes (NDIM-cubic splines whose !  2nd derivatives normal to the boundaries are 0) !  has as many degrees of freedom as the grid has !  nodes.  Thus the smoothness or flexibility of !  the splines is determined by the choice of the !  node grid. ! !### Algorithm !  An overdetermined system of linear equations !  is formed -- one equation for each data point !  plus equations for derivative constraints. !  This system is solved using subroutine [[suprls]]. ! !### Accuracy !  If there is exactly one data point in the !  near vicinity of each node and no extra data, !  the resulting spline will agree with the !  data values to machine accuracy.  However, if !  the problem is overdetermined or the sparse !  data option is utilized, the accuracy is hard !  to predict.  Basically, smooth functions !  require fewer nodes than rough ones for the !  same accuracy. ! !### Timing !  The execution time is roughly proportional !  to `NDATA*NCOF**2` where `NCOF = NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM)`. subroutine splcw ( ndim , xdata , l1xdat , ydata , wdata , ndata , xmin , xmax , & nodes , xtrap , coef , ncf , work , nwrk , ierror ) integer , intent ( in ) :: ndim !! The dimensionality of the problem.  The !! spline is a function of `NDIM` variables or !! coordinates and thus a point in the !! independent variable space is an `NDIM` vector. !! `NDIM` must be in the range `1 <= NDIM <= 4`. integer , intent ( in ) :: l1xdat !! The length of the 1st dimension of `XDATA` in !! the calling program.  `L1XDAT` must be `>= NDIM`. !! !!#### Note: !! For 1-dimensional problems `L1XDAT` is usually 1. integer , intent ( in ) :: ncf !! The length of the array `COEF` in the calling !! program.  If `NCF` is `< NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM)`, !! a fatal error is diagnosed. integer , intent ( in ) :: nwrk !! The length of the array `WORK` in the calling !! program.  If !! `NCOL = NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM)` is the total !! number of nodes, then a fatal error is !! diagnosed if `NWRK` is less than !! `NCOL*(NCOL+1)`. integer , intent ( in ) :: ndata !! The number of data points mentioned in the !! above arguments. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: xdata ( l1xdat , ndata ) !! A collection of locations for the data !! values, i.e., points from the independent !! variable space.  This collection is a !! 2-dimensional array whose 1st dimension !! indexes the `NDIM` coordinates of a given point !! and whose 2nd dimension labels the data !! point.  For example, the data point with !! label `IDATA` is located at the point !! `(XDATA(1,IDATA),...,XDATA(NDIM,IDATA))` where !! the elements of this vector are the values of !! the `NDIM` coordinates.  The location, number !! and ordering of the data points is arbitrary. !! The dimension of `XDATA` is assumed to be !! `XDATA(L1XDAT,NDATA)`. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: ydata ( ndata ) !! A collection of data values corresponding to !! the points in `XDATA`.  `YDATA(IDATA)` is the !! data value associated with the point !! `(XDATA(1,IDATA),...,XDATA(NDIM,IDATA))` in the !! independent variable space.  The spline whose !! coefficients are computed by this routine !! approximates these data values in the least !! squares sense.  The dimension is assumed to be !! `YDATA(NDATA)`. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: wdata (:) !! A collection of weights.  `WDATA(IDATA)` is a !! weight associated with the data point !! labelled `IDATA`.  It should be non-negative, !! but may be of any magnitude.  The weights !! have the effect of forcing greater or lesser !! accuracy at a given point as follows: this !! routine chooses coefficients to minimize the !! sum over all data points of the quantity !!```fortran !!   (WDATA(IDATA)*(YDATA(IDATA) ! spline value at XDATA(IDATA)))**2. !!``` !! Thus, if the reliability !! of a data point is known to be low, the !! corresponding weight may be made small !! (relative to the other weights) so that the !! sum over all data points is affected less by !! discrepencies at the unreliable point.  Data !! points with zero weight are completely !! ignored. !! !!#### Note: !! If `WDATA(1)` is `< 0`, the other !! elements of `WDATA` are not !! referenced, and all weights are !! assumed to be unity. !! !! The dimension is assumed to be `WDATA(NDATA)` !! unless `WDATA(1) < 0.`, in which case the !! dimension is assumed to be 1. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: xmin ( ndim ) !! A vector describing the lower extreme corner !! of the node grid.  A set of evenly spaced !! nodes is formed along each coordinate axis !! and `XMIN(IDIM)` is the location of the first !! node along the `IDIM` axis.  The dimension is !! assumed to be `XMIN(NDIM)`. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: xmax ( ndim ) !! A vector describing the upper extreme corner !! of the node grid.  A set of evenly spaced !! nodes is formed along each coordinate axis !! and `XMAX(IDIM)` is the location of the last !! node along the `IDIM` axis.  The dimension is !! assumed to be `XMAX(NDIM)`. real ( wp ), intent ( in ) :: xtrap !! A parameter to control extrapolation to data !! sparse areas.  The region described by `XMIN` !! and `XMAX` is divided into rectangles, the !! number of which is determined by `NODES`, and !! any rectangle containing a disproportionately !! small number of data points is considered to !! be data sparse (rectangle is used here to !! mean `NDIM`-dimensional rectangle).  If `XTRAP` !! is nonzero the least squares problem is !! augmented with derivative constraints in the !! data sparse areas to prevent the matrix from !! becoming poorly conditioned.  `XTRAP` serves as !! a weight for these constraints, and thus may !! be used to control smoothness in data sparse !! areas.  Experience indicates that unity is a !! good first guess for this parameter. !! !!#### Note: !! If `XTRAP` is zero, substantial !! portions of the routine will be !! skipped, but a singular matrix !! can result if large portions of !! the region are without data. integer , intent ( in ) :: nodes ( ndim ) !! A vector of integers describing the number of !! nodes along each axis.  `NODES(IDIM)` is the !! number of nodes (counting endpoints) along !! the `IDIM` axis and determines the flexibility !! of the spline in that coordinate direction. !! `NODES(IDIM)` must be `>= 4`, but may be as !! large as the arrays `COEF` and `WORK` allow. !! The dimension is assumed to be `NODES(NDIM)`. !! !!#### Note: !! The node grid is completely defined by !! the arguments `XMIN`, `XMAX` and `NODES`. !! The spacing of this grid in the `IDIM` !! coordinate direction is: !!```fortran !!   DX(IDIM) = (XMAX(IDIM)-XMIN(IDIM)) / (NODES(IDIM)-1). !!``` !! A node in this grid may be indexed by !! an `NDIM` vector of integers !! `(IN(1),...,IN(NDIM))` where !! `1 <= IN(IDIM) <= NODES(IDIM)`. !! The location of such a node may be !! represented by an `NDIM` vector !! `(X(1),...,X(NDIM))` where !! `X(IDIM) = XMIN(IDIM) + (IN(IDIM)-1) * DX(IDIM)`. real ( wp ) :: work ( nwrk ) !! A workspace array for solving the least !! squares matrix generated by this routine. !! Its required size is a function of the total !! number of nodes in the node grid.  This !! total, `NCOL = NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM)`, is !! also the number of columns in the least !! squares matrix.  The length of the array `WORK` !! must equal or exceed `NCOL*(NCOL+1)`. real ( wp ), intent ( out ) :: coef ( ncf ) !! The array of coefficients computed by this !! routine.  Each coefficient corresponds to a !! particular basis function which in turn !! corresponds to a node in the node grid.  This !! correspondence between the node grid and the !! array `COEF` is as if `COEF` were an !! `NDIM`-dimensional Fortran array with !! dimensions `NODES(1),...,NODES(NDIM)`, i.e., to !! store the array linearly, the leftmost !! indices are incremented most frequently. !! Hence the length of the `COEF` array must equal !! or exceed the total number of nodes, which is !! `NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM)`.  The computed array !! `COEF` may be used with function [[SPLFE]] !! (or [[SPLDE]]) to evaluate the spline (or its !! derivatives) at an arbitrary point in `NDIM` !! space.  The dimension is assumed to be `COEF(NCF)`. integer , intent ( out ) :: ierror !! An error flag with the following meanings: !! !! * `  0`  No error. !! * `101`  `NDIM` is < 1 or is > 4. !! * `102`  `NODES(IDIM)` is < 4 for some `IDIM`. !! * `103`  `XMIN(IDIM) = XMAX(IDIM)` for some `IDIM`. !! * `104`  `NCF` (size of `COEF`) is `< NODES(1)*...*NODES(NDIM)`. !! * `105`  `NDATA` is `< 1`. !! * `106`  `NWRK` (size of `WORK`) is too small. !! * `107`  [[suprls]] failure (usually insufficient !!   data) -- ordinarily occurs only if !!   `XTRAP` is zero or `WDATA` contains all !!   zeros. real ( wp ) :: x ( 4 ), dx ( 4 ), dxin ( 4 ) integer :: nderiv ( 4 ), in ( 4 ), inmx ( 4 ) integer :: mdim , ib ( 4 ), ibmn ( 4 ), ibmx ( 4 ) !
